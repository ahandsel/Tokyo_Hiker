# Tokyo Hiker

Tokyo hiker's notes and plans.

Believe it or not but there are a lot of hiking options in Tokyo!

## Maps

Can't read any Japanese? → Use AllTrails
* Great App & hiking community
* AllTrails lacks details (restrooms, lunch spots, etc.) for Japanese mountains.

Able to read a little Japanese? → Use [YAMAP](https://yamap.com/)!
* App settings can be set to English 💪 (for the most part)
* Apps and community content are nearly all in Japanese 🥲
* Amazing content as many hikers include trail conditions, transport information, and pictures in their hiking posts.
* YAMAP maps contain vital info like restrooms, benches, and bus stops.

Japanese native? → Still use [YAMAP](https://yamap.com/) 🤣

Why use YAMAP?

TRUST ME! YOU NEED IT!  
Or you will really wished you had when you are crawling back to the train station way past your schedule after hiking in the dark...
