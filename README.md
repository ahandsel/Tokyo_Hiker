# Tokyo Hiker

Here is my notes on hiking as I live in Tokyo.

Believe it or not but there are a lot of hiking options in Tokyo!

## Maps

Can't read any Japanese? → Use AllTrails
  * Great App & hiking community
  * Does not have detailed maps for Japanese mountains (restrooms, lunch spots, etc.)

Can ready a little Japanese? → Use [YAMAP](https://yamap.com/)!
  * App settings can be set to English 💪
  * Apps and community content are nearly all in Japanese 🥲
  * Amazing content as many hikers put in so much details about the trail, transport, and pictures.

Japanese native? → Still use [YAMAP](https://yamap.com/) 🤣

Why use YAMAP?  
[YAMAP / ヤマップ | 登山を安全に楽しむGPSアプリ - YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gypO_QTOXO8&t=1s)

TRUST ME! YOU NEED IT!  
Or you will really wanted it when you are crawling back to the train station way past your schedule after hiking in the dark...
