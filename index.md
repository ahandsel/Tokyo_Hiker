# Tokyo Hiker 🥾
Tokyo hiker's notes and plans.

Believe it or not but there are a lot of hiking options in Tokyo!

---

## Maps

Can't read any Japanese? → Use AllTrails
* Great App & hiking community
* AllTrails lacks details (restrooms, lunch spots, etc.) for Japanese mountains.

Able to read a little Japanese? → Use [YAMAP](https://yamap.com/)!
* App settings can be set to English 💪 (for the most part)
* Apps and community content are nearly all in Japanese 🥲
* Amazing content as many hikers include trail conditions, transport information, and pictures in their hiking posts.
* YAMAP maps contain vital info like restrooms, benches, and bus stops.

Japanese native? → Still use [YAMAP](https://yamap.com/) 🤣

Why use YAMAP?  
[YAMAP / ヤマップ | 登山を安全に楽しむGPSアプリ - YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gypO_QTOXO8&t=1s)

TRUST ME! YOU NEED IT!  
Or you will really wished you had when you are crawling back to the train station way past your schedule after hiking in the dark...
